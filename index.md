###### About me
*Hello!* I am a current senior at **UC San Diego** studying Computer Science. I started coding in high school and haven't stopped since. I originally attended CSULB for the first two years of my college career and now I'm a second year transfer at UCSD. I'm **_extremely_ excited** <sub>~~but also pretty nervous~~</sub> to be attending this school. ***Go Tritons!***
